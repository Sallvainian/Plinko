# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Executive Summary
Transform the existing Plinko game into a classroom competition system where different class periods compete for points. The system will track scores by period, provide teacher controls for chip management, and display a real-time leaderboard.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR1**: The scoring system shall be changed from multipliers to fixed point values for each of the 9 bins as follows: 100, 500, 1000, 0, 10,000, 0, 1000, 500, 100.

- **FR2**: The system will be controlled entirely by a teacher; no student authentication or login shall be required.

- **FR3**: The system shall manage multiple classes identified by a period number (e.g., "Period 1").

- **FR4**: Each class period must have a customizable nickname, a chip count, and a persistent total point score.

- **FR5**: Each period shall start with 5 chips at the beginning of each day.

- **FR6**: A teacher must be able to add or remove chips for any period in increments of one (+1 / -1).

- **FR7**: The system shall prevent a period from dropping a chip if their chip count is zero.

- **FR8**: A teacher-only admin panel shall be accessible at the /admin route and be protected by a simple password.

- **FR9**: From the admin panel, a teacher must be able to: edit period nicknames, add/remove chips, reset all periods' daily chips to the default, and trigger a manual data sync.

- **FR10**: The UI must include a period selector to choose the active class before gameplay.

- **FR11**: The main game UI must display the current period's name and remaining chip count.

- **FR12**: A leaderboard displaying all period nicknames and total scores shall be available and can be toggled on or off from the main view.

- **FR13**: The admin panel shall be a separate view from the main game board.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR1**: The application shall be a static site deployed to Vercel, utilizing its free tier.

- **NFR2**: All persistent data (scores, nicknames, chip counts) shall be stored in a Supabase database, utilizing its free tier.

- **NFR3**: The application must not require serverless functions for its core client-side game logic.

- **NFR4**: Data will auto-sync to Supabase after a period uses its last chip, with a manual sync option available. Failed syncs will be queued for retry without blocking gameplay.

- **NFR5**: The application must be functional on Android-based smartboards (for display) and teacher Chromebooks (for admin).

- **NFR6**: The system requires a standard internet connection to function.

- **NFR7**: The UI for selecting a period must be quick to operate to support transitions within 40-minute class periods.
